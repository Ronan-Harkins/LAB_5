# LAB_5
Lab 5 Embedded 
### Objective
The objective of this lab is to see how different anolog sensors can be used with the MSP430FR2355's on board ADC componets. For the first anolag device that was used was the built in tempeture sensor and the second sensor that was used was a photoresistor. These sensors had to be used by the ADC and display values that make sense to the reader.
